  This is my favourite anime. I love the the storyline.anybody that has never
  watched one piece i urge you to consiider it. its one of the longest running
  animes spanning more than 2 decades.if it were bad, it would have been cancled
  already

<h3>Hunter Hunter</h3>

<p>
  Really cool anime. the author is the best when it comes to making you feel as
  if you're in the anime.It also has one of my favorite power systems.when it
  comes to the o.g's and anime in general, HunterXhunter anime is one ill
  classify as Crème de la crème
</p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>

  naruto.when it comes to animation the emotions that you feel while watching a
  cercain scene or a characters backstories are naruto is up there
